12-Week ML/DL/LLM Intensive Study Plan

This 12-week roadmap (4 hours per day) is designed to strengthen coding (DSA), system design, and deep learning/LLM skills for top-tier ML roles. Each week allocates daily time to all three areas (roughly 1 h DSA, 1 h System Design, 2 h DL/LLM), with specific tasks and projects. Key resources are cited for guidance
designgurus.io
huggingface.co
.

Daily Schedule (example): Spend ~1 h on algorithm practice (LeetCode/DSA); 1 h on system design theory or case studies; 2 h on deep learning/LLM topics (courses, labs, or projects). Adjust as needed, but balance all three pillars every day to reinforce learning.
Week 1 (Setup and Fundamentals)

    DSA (Arrays & Strings): Review array/string basics and two-pointer techniques. Solve several easy/medium problems on LeetCode (e.g. array sum, reverse string) to build fluency

    huggingface.co
    . Aim to achieve reasonable accuracy and learn the workflow (data tokenization, training loop).

Week 5 (Hashing & Sets, System APIs, RAG Concepts)

    DSA (Hash Tables & Sorting): Cover hash maps/sets and common sort/search algorithms. Do practice problems on “two-sum”, “group anagrams”, etc. Also review binary search and quicksort basics.

    System Design (API Design & Scaling): Focus on designing scalable APIs: rate limiting, gateways, versioning. Study how to scale reads (read replicas) and writes (sharding). Example: design a high-throughput search API (consider caching and pagination).

    DL/LLM (RAG and LangChain): Learn Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): how to index documents into vectors and retrieve relevant context. Read LangChain tutorials on RAG
    python.langchain.com
    . Topics: embeddings, vector stores (e.g. Pinecone, FAISS) and retrievers.

    Project: Build a basic RAG pipeline: choose a text corpus (e.g. Wikipedia subset), split into chunks, embed them, store in a vector database. Then, using Hugging Face or OpenAI API, retrieve relevant chunks for queries and generate answers. Tools: LangChain or Hugging Face + a vector DB.

Week 6 (Advanced DP, Caching & Front-end Scalability, Prompt Engineering)

    System Design (Caching & API Scaling): Deep dive caching strategies (write-through vs write-back), CDN usage, and load balancer algorithms (round-robin, least connections). Study a case: design a photo-sharing service (think CDN for static images, cache hot data).

    DL/LLM (Prompt Engineering & Agents): Study prompt engineering best practices (from Full Stack DL bootcamp
    fullstackdeeplearning.com
    ). Learn to use and chain LLMs via tools like LangChain agents. Try simple multi-step tasks with a prompt template. Resources: Full Stack Bootcamp or HuggingFace docs.

    Project: Develop an LLM-powered agent using LangChain: for example, an “email summarizer” that retrieves a set of emails (simulated data) and outputs a summary. Incorporate embeddings for retrieval and use an LLM to generate the summary.

Week 7 (Backtracking, Vector Stores, Distributed Training Basics)

    DSA (Backtracking & Bit Manipulation): Solve backtracking problems (e.g. permutations, Sudoku) and review bitwise operations (bit masks, shifts). This refines problem-solving flexibility.

    neptune.ai
    . Also cover data streaming (Kafka) and consistency models (eventual vs strong consistency).

    DL/LLM (Distributed Training): Learn about multi-GPU training: data parallelism (PyTorch DDP, Horovod) vs model parallelism. Read NVIDIA or PyTorch docs on distributed training. Optionally try a small DDP example or use Google Colab’s TPU.

    Project: Join a Kaggle competition or mimic one: use a public dataset (e.g. text or image) and try to improve accuracy by experimenting with larger models or data augmentation. Document workflow and results.

Week 8 (Complex Systems, Model Serving, MLOps)

    DSA (Practicing Mocks): Attempt a timed LeetCode contest (approx. 2 problems in 2–3 hours). Review solutions. Identify weak spots (e.g. greedy or graph) and revisit them.

    System Design (End-to-End Architecture): Practice designing a complete system (e.g. video streaming platform): include user service, content distribution network, databases, load balancers, cache layers. Emphasize trade-offs (cost vs latency) and security considerations (authentication, rate limits).

    DL/LLM (Model Serving): Learn model deployment: TorchServe for PyTorch
    pytorch.org
    and NVIDIA Triton for optimized serving
    developer.nvidia.com
    . Try deploying a trained model (e.g. the BERT model from Week 4) as an API (TorchServe or FastAPI), or experiment with Triton Server.

    Project: Containerize and serve one of your DL models via an API. For example, package your sentiment model from Week 4 and expose a REST endpoint that returns predictions. Alternatively, deploy a vision model using Triton Inference Server.

Week 9 (Revision & Interview Prep 1)

    DL/LLM (Deep Dive Topics): Be prepared to discuss any DL/LLM concept: attention, beam search, supervised vs reinforcement fine-tuning, etc. Review major papers/tools (e.g. ChatGPT architecture, LangChain agents). Ensure familiarity with Hugging Face ecosystem.

    Project Wrap-up: Present your top 2 projects as if to an interviewer: what problem they solve, your approach, results, and learnings. Practice elevator pitches for them. Update GitHub README and your portfolio with highlights.

    Mock Interviews: Schedule at least 2 full mock rounds per week (coding+design). Record or note performance. Use feedback to refine communication and time management. Revisit any stumbling blocks immediately.

Week 12 (Mock Interviews & Transition)

    DSA (Final Mocks & Strengths): Continue solving one timed set of problems each day. Focus on speed with accuracy. Review any last-minute topics and be comfortable with common patterns.

    System Design (Final Mocks & Presentation): Perform final mock design interviews. Practice explaining designs without diagrams if needed (word-picture explanation). Emphasize clarity and confidence.

    DL/LLM (Discussion Prep): Be ready to discuss your DL/ML decisions: choice of model architectures, handling overfitting, deployment strategy, etc. Prepare to answer LLM-specific questions like “how would you fine-tune an LLM on small data?” or “optimize an LLM for low-latency serving (quantization, distillation)
    medium.com
    .”

    Interview Strategy: In the last week, shift focus mostly to practicing interviews in realistic conditions. Study company-specific info if applying to Google/Meta/etc. Rehearse behavioral answers and ensure your resume/projects clearly align with ML/LLM roles.

    Celebrate & Reflect: By now you’ve built a solid foundation. Congratulate yourself for consistent effort. Use any remaining time to relax before interviews, keeping fundamentals fresh.
